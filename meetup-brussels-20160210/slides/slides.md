# Welcome to the meetup !
## How to quickly bootstrap ?

1. If not already done, flash you SD card with the 0.6.1 Hector image

2. Connect your laptop to the shared Wifi "Dadouâ€™s MacBook Air" (dockerbel)

3. Insert the SD card, connect the Pi to Ethernet and power it with micro-USB

4. Come at the "shack" to tell us which hostname you want to use. Be creative !

5. After we have configured your hostname, ssh to your host :
  * User : root
  * password : hypriot
  * Hostname : <you hostname>.local

6. Upgrade embedded docker tools :
  ```
  $ apt-get update && apt-get install --only-upgrade docker-hypriot docker-compose
  ```

# Now let's workshop !
## Goal :

* We want to launch the Docker demo "voting app" on a cluster of Raspberry Pis.
  - Docker on ARM board ? Voting app ?

* This voting app will be launch on Swarm cluster.
  - How to bootstrap Swarm ?

* Workshop logistic : we'll group by 3 boards : 1 master, 2 nodes
  - Meet, Talk and Work together !

# Now let's workshop !

# Now let's workshop !
## [Voting app](https://github.com/docker/example-voting-app) 2/2 - Simplified view :

```
services:
  voting-app:
    build: ./voting-app/.
    ports:
      - "5000:80"
    links:
      - redis

  result-app:
    build: ./result-app/.
    ports:
      - "5001:80"
    links:
      - db

  worker:
    build: ./worker
    links:
      - db
      - redis

  redis:
    image: redis
    ports: ["6379"]

  db:
    image: postgres:9.4
    volumes:
      - "db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data"
```

# Now let's workshop !
## ARM board ? Which image ?

HypriotOS helps us to run Docker : easy !
```
$ docker -v
```
but which image to run ?

```
$ docker run -ti --rm alpine:latest sh
... ERROR ...
```

You have 2 good starting points :
```
$ docker run -ti --rm hypriot/rpi-alpine-scratch echo "Lightweight ARM image"
Lightweight ARM image

$ docker run -ti --rm resin/rpi-raspbian echo "Complete ARM image"
Complete ARM image
```

# Now let's workshop !
## ARM Voting App : mastering docker-compose

We made your life easy : an ARM voting app ready to go !

```
git clone https://github.com/jmMeessen/rpi-voting-app
```

* A generic `docker-compose.yml` using the DockerHub

* Extended by `dev-compose.yml` that will build images from sources

* Another extending with `workshop.yml` that will use a local private registry
