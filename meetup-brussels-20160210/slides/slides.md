# Welcome to the meetup !
## How to quickly bootstrap ?

1. If not already done, flash you SD card with the 0.6.1 Hector image.

2. Connect your laptop to the shared Wifi "Dadouâ€™s MacBook Air" (dockerbel)

3. Insert the SD card, connect the Pi to Ethernet and power it with micro-USB

4. Use `nmap 192.168.2.0/24` to locate your Pi's IP and access it with :
  ```
  ssh pi@<FOUND IP>
  ```

5. Set an hostname by editing `/boot/occidentalis.txt` and `sudo reboot now`

6. Upgrade embedded docker tools :
  ```
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get upgrade docker docker-compose
  ```
