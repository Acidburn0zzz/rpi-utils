# Boot2Raspberry

In order to play with Docker on the Raspberry Pis, we have to "dump" a working OS to an SD-Card and boot on it.

You'll find [here](http://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/) a set of [Rapsbian](http://www.raspbian.org) and Docker-ready images :
* Dowload the latest one (When writing this : ```hypriot-rpi-20150416-201537.img.zip```, based on jessie, with Docker 1.6.0)
* Dump it on your SD/Micro-SD card using these [Mac OS / Windows / Linux instructions](http://computers.tutsplus.com/articles/how-to-flash-an-sd-card-for-raspberry-pi--mac-53600)
* Just boot on the OS : ssh is enabled, with a default user named "pi" (password : raspberry).
